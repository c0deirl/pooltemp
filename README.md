# Pool Temperature Sensor
Pool Water Temperature Sensor and Web Interface for an ESP32.  
This code is for an ESP32 Devkit, and a water temperature sensor. With Summer around the corner, I wanted to come up with a wirless pool temperature system, to monitor the temperature of the water in my pool!  
There are all kinds of wireless water temperature sensors out there, but I wanted an affordible way to monitor the temperature of the water, the outside air temperature, and the temperature of the pool house, and report it all back to Home Assistant for automation purposes.
